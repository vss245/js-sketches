# intro:

first foray into javascript with p5.js, processing and tone.js.
draw is very simple particle drawing tool, visualizer is a music visualizer (amplitude and frequency),
synth is (soon to be) a visual synthesizer (e.g. draw and click to generate music)

# based on:

p5, Tone, Processing, CodingTrain tutorials

# to do:

work on synthesizer, add more visualizations
